Today, I am going to teach you how to make a 
SIMPLE GOOGLE MAP APPLICATION

Go to File/New/New Project

APPLICATION NAME
The name of your App

COMPANY DOMAIN:
 Company domain provides a qualifier that will be appended to the package name;
 Android Studio will remember this qualifier for each new project you create.

PACKAGE NAME:
 The package name uniquely identifies the app on the device; it is also unique in the Google Play store. 
 This means that once you have published an app with this package name, you can never change it;
 doing so would cause your app to be treated as a brand new app, and existing users of your app will not see the newly packaged app as an update.
 
 PROJECT LOCATION:
 Is the location where your App will be save in your computer/laptop
 
 
1. ===============================================================================================
Specify what platform are you building.

PHONE AND TABLET

	MINIMUM SDK 
		is the minimum android version that your App will be compatible...
		If you want your App to run on more devices, make it low as possible
			
WEAR 
	are Android Apps for Google Watches
	
TV 
	are Android Apps for Google TV
	
ANDROID AUTO
	are Android Apps for Automobile/Car
	
GLASS
	are Android Apps for Eye Glasses

Our App is for Phone and Tablets so we will select Phone and Tablets
	
2. ==================================================================================================

Because we are making a Google Map, we will choose Google Maps Activity
so that Android Studio will generate a Application Google Map Ready...
It will generate some requirement automatically that is for Google Map Application Only 
so that we wont have to do that. Our work will be lessen.

3. =================================================================================================

ACTIVITY NAME	
	is the name of the activity that will be launced when you open our App in the phone
	it is the JAVA file where you will put all your codes and the functionality of your App
	
LAYOUT NAME	
	is the layout where you will design the appearance of your App. 
	
TITLE
	is the name of the app that will appear on the phone when you already installed it
	
THEN FINISH
	

4. ================================================================================================


OnMapReadyCallback
	Callback interface that returns a method(OnMapReadyCallback) when the map is ready to be used.

GoogleMap
	This is the main class of the Google Maps Android API and
	is the entry point for all methods related to the map.

SupportMapFragment
	This fragment is the simplest way to place a map in an application.
	It's a wrapper around a view of a map to automatically handle the necessary life cycle needs.
	
.getMapAsync(this)
	to acquire GoogleMap use this method
	
====================================================================================================================
	/**
     * Manipulates the map once available.
     * This callback is triggered when the map is ready to be used.
     * This is where we can add markers or lines, add listeners or move the camera. In this case,
     * we just add a marker near Sydney, Australia.
     * If Google Play services is not installed on the device, the user will be prompted to install
     * it inside the SupportMapFragment. This method will only be triggered once the user has
     * installed Google Play services and returned to the app.
     */
	
	 public void onMapReady(GoogleMap googleMap)
	 {
		mMap = googleMap;

        // Add a marker in Sydney and move the camera
        LatLng sydney = new LatLng(-34, 151);
        mMap.addMarker(new MarkerOptions().position(sydney).title("Marker in Sydney"));
        mMap.moveCamera(CameraUpdateFactory.newLatLng(sydney));
	 }
	 
=================================================================================================================
