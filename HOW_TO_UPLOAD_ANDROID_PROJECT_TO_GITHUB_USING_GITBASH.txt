1. FIRST GO TO WWW.GITHUB.COM AND MAKE A REPOSITORY


2. THEN YOU WILL NEED TO NAVIGATE TO THE PROJECT FOLDER IN YOUR COMPUTER USING GITBASH. WHEN YOU GET THERE YOU DO:

			// git init

TO INITIATES A NEW GIT REPOSITORY IN THAT DIRECTORY.

3. WHEN YOU'VE DONE THAT, YOU NEED TO REGISTER THAT NEW REPO WITH A REMOTE (where you'll upload -- push -- your files to)
	WHICH IN THIS CASE WILL BE GITHUB. YOU'LL GET THE CORRECT URL FROM YOUR REPO ON GITHUB

			// git remote add origin https://github.com/[username]/[reponame].git

4. YOU NEED TO ADD YOUR EXISTING FILES TO YOUR LOCAL COMMIT:

			// git add .   # this adds all the files

5. THEN YOU NEED TO MAKE AN INITIAL COMMIT, SO YOU DO:

			// git commit -a -m "Initial commit" 		# this stages your files locally for commit. 
											# they haven't actually been pushed yet
								  
6. NOW YOU'VE CREATED A COMMIT IN YOUR LOCAL REPO, BUT NOT IN THE REMOTE ONE. TO PUT IT ON THE REMOTE, YOU DO THE SECONDS LINE YOU POSTED:
			
			// git push -u origin --all
