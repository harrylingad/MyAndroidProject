LocationRequest

	--- create this one to store parameters for requests to the fused location provider.
		because the parameters determine the levels of accuracy requested.
	--- You can set the parameters update interval, fastest update interval, and priority.
	
	
	> setInterval()
		--- This method sets the rate in milliseconds at which your app prefers to receive location updates.
		--- Note that the location updates may be faster than this rate if another app is receiving updates at a faster rate,
			or slower than this rate, or there may be no updates at all (if the device has no connectivity, for example).
			
	> setFastestInterval()
		--- this method sets the fastest rate in milliseconds at which your app can handle location updates.
		--- You need to set this rate because other apps also effect the rate at which updates are sent.
		--- The Google Play services location APIs send out updates at the fastest rate that any app has requested with setInterval(). 
			If this rate is faster than your app can handle, you may encounter problems with UI flicker or data overflow.
			To prevent this, call setFastestInterval() to set an upper limit to the update rate.
			
	>setPriority()
		--- This method sets the priority of the request, which gives the Google Play services location services a 
			strong hint about which location sources to use.
